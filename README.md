Learning to create a git repository

I'm an undergraduate student studying electrical engineering at UMass Amherst. Of particular interest to me is the intersection between computer science, electronics & neurobiology. Learning and gaining skills are very important to me. All humans should be able to start and maintain a fire. In my leisure time, I enjoy listening to philosophy podcasts while knitting. Peace out.
